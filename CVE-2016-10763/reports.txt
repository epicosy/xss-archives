CVE-2016-10763: XSS in Camptix Event Ticketing Plugin

HackerOne Discussion: And the second one is kind of self-xss, caused by also the Ticket title of the plugin but in the coupons page. The second part of the video is valid, though, because it is triggered within wp-admin. I'll look into that and give you an update soon, when I have more details. I was able to create XSS on the front-end with a normal post. I've attached a few screenshots. It might depend on the theme, and which function they're using to output the title. The screenshots are from a custom theme, but I also tested with TwentySixteen and it worked there too. The visual tab encoding < and > is expected behavior. WordPress uses current_user_can( 'unfiltered_html' ) to control whether or not a user can submit potentially dangerous input. By default, Admins and Editors are allowed to use script tags, etc, but all other roles are blocked. The encoding that the editor does on the Visual tab isn't intended as a security measure. It encodes the characters because sometimes users want to create blog posts about HTML, and want to display code samples. For example, a post about the HTML title tag. All users have access to both the Visual and HTML tabs, regardless of their security role. Sanitizing the post content is a separate mechanism, and that's based on the user's role. When the post is saved, if the current user doesn't have the unfiltered_html capability, then the post contents are passed through the wp_kses function to strip out things like <script>. By default, only Editors and Admins have unfiltered_html.
