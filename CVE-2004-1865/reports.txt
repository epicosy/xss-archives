CVE-2004-1865: bBlog blog name cross-site scripting 

X-Force Report: bBlog is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. A remote attacker could post a blog message containing script embedded within the blog name, which would be executed in the victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting site, once the message is viewed. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal other user's cookie-based authentication credentials. Consequences: Gain Access.

BugTrq Message: Bblog, a blogging system scripted in PHP does not perform sufficient filtering when submitting a blog name. The severity of this flaw however, is low as the required privileges to access the administration panel for bblog is superuser. The flaw lies in bblog/index.php?b=options, where an *evil* attacker can quite possibly hijack a session. Submitting the blog name with the value of "< script alert(document.cookie);< / script >" will insert this into the title of the blog, which in turn, speaks for itself. 

SourceForge Ticket: in 0.7.4 The blog entry title field seems prone to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. The blog/comment body text seems prone to XSS as well.

SecurityFocus Info: BBlog Index.PHP HTML Injection Vulnerability. Class: Input Validation Error. Vulnerable: bBlog bBlog 0.7.2, 0.7.3, 0.7.4

SecurityFocus Discussion: bBlog is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content. Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
