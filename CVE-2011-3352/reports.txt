CVE-2011-3352 Detail: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Zikula Application Framework

ImmuniWeb Advisory: Vulnerable Versions: 1.3.0, build #3168 and probably prior. Tested Version: 1.3.0, build #3168. High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Zikula Application Framework, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks. 1) Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zikula Application Framework Input passed via the "themename" parameter to "ztemp/view_compiled/Theme/theme_admin_setasdefault.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator's browser session in context of affected website. The following PoC code is available: http://host/index.php?module=theme&type=admin&func=setasdefault&themename=%3 Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

BugZillaReport: It was found that the Zikula web application framework did not properly sanitize the 'themename' parameter, while setting particular theme as a default one, modifying the theme or deleting it. A remote attacker, with Zikula administrator privilege, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web script code in the context of the affected website.

SecrityFocus Discussion: Zikula Application Framework is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. Zikula Application Framework 1.3.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
