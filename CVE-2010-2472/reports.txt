CVE-2010-2472: Locale module cross site scripting

Drupal Advisory: Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display of language codes, native and English language names properly. While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary administrator input is allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a role with the 'administer languages' permission. This issue affects Drupal 5.21 and 6.15.
